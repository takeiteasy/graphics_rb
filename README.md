# graphics_rb

Ruby FFI binding for my [software rendering library](https://github.com/takeiteasy/graphics/). Also included `rgi.rb` is a framework to quickly prototype and test.

The bindings are generated dynamically by the make file using information from [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags). Since the underlying graphics library was made to be cross-platform, so is this. Currently the make file only works on OSX, but only needs tweeking to support Windows and Linux.

There are a few examples included, showing functionality of `rgi.rb` and raw `graphics.rb`. RGI was made to be zero-hassle to start making stuff. However, using the raw bindings isn't really difficult. The raycaster was adapted from an example on [lodev.org](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/files/raycaster_flat.cpp).
